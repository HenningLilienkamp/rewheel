# rewheel
Another python based code library to train and employ deep learning models for image recognition.
This is a dummy codebase to demonstrate the following skills:
  - Object oriented programming
  - Deep learning with pytorch
  - Containerization with Docker
  - Version control with git

# Usage
For testing rewheel, I suggest to use the dockerized version of the application available via: ...

# Step by step tutorial

[1] - Download the MNIST handwritten digits dataset from ...
[2] - Install docker on your system
[3] - Get the rewheel docker container
[4] - Launch the container via ... (NVIDIA cuda is supported if a cuda compatible GPU is available.)
[5] - Explore rewheel via the jupyter notebook MNIST_classification_tutorial.ipynb in the docker container
